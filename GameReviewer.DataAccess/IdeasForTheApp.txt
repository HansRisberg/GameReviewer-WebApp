This is a document for typing out ideas for the app, and to see what structure and functions I need to make it work. 

I want a way to let users favourit games, which show up on their profile. (Perhaps even rate them 1-5 stars or something)

I want users to look at other users profile. 

I want a user to be able to update their profile info. 

I want a user to send friends request, add/join groups with other users. 

I want a user to be able to write a review of a game. Perhaps show their reviews on their profile, and on the gamedetail page. 
Maybe sort the reviews on the gamedetail page based on "upvotes/downvotes" 

I want a user to be able to "Follow" other users. 

Perhaps a role system, where only Admins can add games to the database? Or open it to the public and have a system for not getting duplicate games or bad actor inputs?
